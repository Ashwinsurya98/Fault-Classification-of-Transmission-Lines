# Fault-Classification-of-Transmission-Lines
By using Simulink in matlab an Transmission Line model has been developed and using this model data has been generated
Using  Neural Net Pattern Recognition Tool in MATLAB an ann model is developed which tells us about fault presence in 3 phases of line
Machine Learning Fault Classification algorithms like ANN, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes were used. All the Algorithms were trained and tested with data generated and ANN among them has the highest accuracy of around 95% followed by Random Forest.
While developing models the parameter tuning was done using Grid Search CV and K-fold cross validation was done for better accuracy.
